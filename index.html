        <h3><a id="accuracy-for-testing-history" class="anchor" href="#accuracy-for-testing-history" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accurate emulation: testing and historical preservation</h3>
          <p>As a fork of <a href="http://dosbox.com">DOSBox</a>, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. DOSBox-X however goes further, with a focus on <i>accurate</i> emulation of the hardware and many more ways to tweak and configure the DOS virtual machine! We believe that a better way to emulate the legacy PC platform is to give the user all the options they need to emulate everything from original IBM PC hardware with 64KB of RAM all the way up to late 90's hardware, whatever it takes to get that game or software package to run. Our goal is to eventually make DOSBox-X a complete emulation package that covers all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 9x based hardware scenarios, including peripherals, motherboards, CPUs, and all manner of hardware that was made for PC hardware of that time.</p>
  
        <h3><a id="accuracy-for-retrocoding" class="anchor" href="#accuracy-for-retrocoding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accurate emulation: For retro-coding</h3>
          <p>We hope to implement emulation that is accurate enough to make retro-programming possible with confidence the program will run properly on actual hardware. The many tweaks and configuration paraters are there to help you describe to DOSBox-X what particular hardware configuration you want to emulate for that goal. With the power of configuration, you can also test your program against odd scenarios or problems with hardware that might cause some programs to crash or malfunction.</p>

        <h3><a id="accuracy-for-win9x" class="anchor" href="#accuracy-for-win9x" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accurate emulation: For Windows 9x emulation</h3>
          <p>We also hope to make DOSBox-X a great platform for emulating Windows 95/98/ME and software. Right now there are plenty of Windows 9x games that are unusable on NT-based Windows systems, and unusable in emulators because Windows 9x seems to be the hardest for emulators to deal with. By adding full support for Windows 9x emulator and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games could be brought out of the dustbin and enjoyed once more.</p>

	  <p>DOSBox-X maintains a <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/wiki">wiki</a> where we take notes on how to configure various software to run in DOSBox-X.<br>Windows binaries are released periodically for testing. If you find any issues feel free to check our <a href="">issues</a> tracker.<br>If you have any questions feel free to ask them on a commit that causes you problems.</p>
