# Instructions for using SDL2
- Clone https://github.com/aybe/SDL-mirror repository
- Switch to the branch ```release-2.0.5-dosbox-x```
- Build solutions for ```x86``` and ```x64``` in ```vs2017``` folder

# Notes
Assuming that ```dosbox-x``` and ```SDL-mirror``` are in the same parent folder, e.g. c:\username\documents\GitHub, otherwise you'll have to update your VC++ directories.
