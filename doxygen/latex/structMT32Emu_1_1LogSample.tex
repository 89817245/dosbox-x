\subsection{Detailed Description}
L\-A32 performs wave generation in the log-\/space that allows replacing multiplications by cheap additions It's assumed that only low-\/bit multiplications occur in a few places which are unavoidable like these\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item interpolation of exponent table (obvious, a delta value has 4 bits)
\item computation of resonance amp decay envelope (the table contains values with 1-\/2 \char`\"{}1\char`\"{} bits except the very first value 31 but this case can be found using inversion)
\item interpolation of P\-C\-M samples (obvious, the wave position counter is in the linear space, there is no log() table in the chip) and it seems to be implemented in the same way as in the Boss chip, i.\-e. right shifted additions which involved noticeable precision loss Subtraction is supposed to be replaced by simple inversion As the logarithmic sine is always negative, all the logarithmic values are treated as decrements
