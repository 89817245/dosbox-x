    <body><h1 style="font-size: 1.4em; padding-bottom: 1em;">DOSBox-X development and testing log begins<span style="font-size: 0.85em;"> â€” 2018/04/21 18:28</span></h1><div>
        <p>I know that it's not obvious from the commit log, the git repository, or the project itself, but there's a lot of interesting work and discovery in working on DOSBox-X.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this blog is to document these discoveries and notes.</p>
        <p>This blog will eventually get a proper web design layout. Putting up content however, is more important than making it look pretty.</p>
        <p>Despite the name of the blog, this will also cover DOSLIB development as well. DOSLIB and DOSBox-X are developed in parallel to improve emulation and document the behavior of actual hardware.</p>
