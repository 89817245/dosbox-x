        <p>I know that it's not obvious from the commit log, the git repository, or the project itself, but there's a lot of interesting work and discovery in working on DOSBox-X.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this blog is to document these discoveries and notes.</p>
        <p>This blog will eventually get a proper web design layout. Putting up content however, is more important than making it look pretty.</p>
